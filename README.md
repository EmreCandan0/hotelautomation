#Project Objective:  
The objective of the project is to establish a database infrastructure for a hotel reservation system, 
ensuring that processes such as accounting, customer management, reservations, and room management operate efficiently and in an organized manner.  

#Problem:
Traditional reservation systems suffer from data complexity and redundant data entries, leading to errors and confusion.
This creates challenges in data analysis and reporting. Additionally, unauthorized access to managerial data poses security risks.  

#Solution:  
Data has been structured using normalization techniques and stored in a well-designed relational database. 
This structure facilitates the centralized management of reservations, customers, rooms, and expenses. Managerial data is securely stored.  

#Approach:
Using PostgreSQL, data in tables has been linked with strong key constraints (primary keys and foreign keys). 
Normalization has been applied to prevent data redundancy and improve efficiency. Managerial data is encrypted for security.  

#Design and Functionality:
The frontend design features a modern, efficient structure that supports all CRUD operations while adhering to standard database design principles.
The database follows all fundamental principles of standard database design and supports all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a modern and efficient structure. 
The system ensures seamless performance and has been tested to work without issues.
